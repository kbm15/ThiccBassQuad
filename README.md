# ThiccBassQuad

Here you'll find the instructions for building your own quadraphonic setup for any room, a meaty subwoofer and all the files for making the amplifiers.

The base project is 4x20W speakers for the quad setting and one big 200W subwoofer for the bass. Logic behind this is that the audio without a bass speaker is so lackluster, then the addition and modularity of having one of this in your setup.

We want to power this from a 12v powersupply, so the options on the bass amp are limited. We will try to reach 70w out of the IC.

This project is designed for show at the local IEEE days in Zaragoza, where we build simple Class A amps from scratch, based on the BJT build.
